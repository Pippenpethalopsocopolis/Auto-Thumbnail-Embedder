# Auto-Thumbnail-Embedder
This is a automatic video and thumbnail embedder. If you provide the neccesary part of the code with the embedding link this script will get the thumbnail automaticly.
Note: This example works with youtube thumbnails but if you get the link for the thumbnails in other websites you can use it as your thumbnail in your website.
Algoritm works like this: script searches the video ID from the embedding link you provide, when it finds, script using it to extract the thumbnail from the youtube's own thumbnail links.
Like I said, this example works with youtube but if you provide it with the right links using web developer tools you can do it for almost all websites except for few who doesnt match their video id
with their thumbnail id(weird).
